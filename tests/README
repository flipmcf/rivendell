Rivendell Test Suite

These files are only necessary to run when developing and testing changes
to rivendell source code.

to run tests, use `make test` (or `make check`) to run the test suite.

These Tests are NOT meant to be compiled and used in a production installation.
They are meant to be utilized only in development builds, typically a programmer's
personal computer working directly on rivendell source code.

Testing is not built by default. these steps must be taken before
testing can be done on a local development enviornment.


1. googletest framework must be installed on the development enviornment
2. `./configure_build.sh --enable-testing`

This can be followed by the `make test` command where one would normally execute `make` or `make install`
